# NYTimes Top Stories

## Overview:

This is an application that displays articles from the [NY Times Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview). A user has the ability to see the top stories overall, or filter by catergory. If an article sparks a users interest, they can click an article to see more details about it.

This application was built as a take home challenge from the Mod 4 curriculum at Turing School of Software & Design and was completed over the duration of 8 hours. Original project spec can be found [here](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe).
